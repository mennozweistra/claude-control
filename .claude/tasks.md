  - Browser-tools MCP more basic but still functional
  - No conflicts between the two MCP servers

### [x] 9 - Test Playwright MCP with Chromium Instead of Chrome

  4. [x] Verify MCP connection with `claude mcp list` (FAILED - connection failed)
  5. [x] Test browser navigation to https://www.lovetoknowpets.com/life-with-pets/free-funny-cat-pictures-slideshow (browser-tools MCP functional)
  6. [x] Test screenshot functionality (browser-tools MCP functional)
  7. [x] Test page snapshot functionality (not tested - Playwright MCP unavailable)
  8. [x] Compare results with Chrome-based setup (same failure pattern)
- **Test Plan**: 
  1. [x] Confirm Playwright MCP server appears in `claude mcp list` (FAILED - same as previous tests)
  2. [x] Successfully navigate to test website (browser-tools MCP functional)
  3. [x] Take screenshot and verify it works (browser-tools MCP functional)
  4. [x] Verify page snapshot provides detailed accessibility tree (not possible - Playwright MCP not connecting)

### [ ] 10 - Test Fresh Playwright MCP Installation After Complete Reinstall
- **Status**: Started
- **Description**: After completely clearing all Playwright MCP configurations, cache files, global installations, and doing a fresh install with @playwright/mcp and @playwright/test packages, test the Playwright MCP functionality after Claude Code restart.
- **Context**: 
  - Previous tasks 1-9 showed persistent MCP connection failures despite various browser configurations
  - Task 8 showed temporary success after restart, indicating restart may be key factor
  - Complete reinstall performed: removed all configs, cleared cache/global installs, fresh npm install
  - Current config: `claude mcp add playwright "npx -y @playwright/mcp@0.0.32"`
  - Packages installed: @playwright/mcp (global), @playwright/test (local)
- **Implementation Plan**: 
  1. [x] Verify Claude Code has been restarted with fresh MCP configuration
  2. [x] Check MCP server status with `claude mcp list` (FAILED - needs restart with correct config)
  3. [x] If connection fails, check MCP logs in ~/.cache/claude-cli-nodejs/*playwright* for error details (Command parsing issue resolved)
  4. [x] Configure with correct format: `npx -y @playwright/mcp@0.0.32` (READY FOR RESTART)
  5. [x] Restart Claude Code and verify MCP connection (PARTIALLY FAILED - command not found error)
  6. [x] Troubleshoot ENOENT error: found `-y` flag in npx command causes parsing issues
  7. [x] Reconfigure with simpler format: `npx @playwright/mcp@0.0.32` (without -y flag)
  8. [x] Restart Claude Code again and verify MCP connection with corrected configuration (FAILED - still connection issues)
  9. [x] Test alternative configuration: `npx --yes @playwright/mcp@0.0.32` instead of `npx -y` (FAILED - still ENOENT error)
  10. [x] Test simplified configuration without version/flags: `npx @playwright/mcp` (READY FOR RESTART)
  5. [ ] Navigate to test website: https://www.lovetoknowpets.com/life-with-pets/free-funny-cat-pictures-slideshow
  6. [ ] Test screenshot functionality via Playwright MCP tools
  7. [ ] Test page snapshot functionality for detailed accessibility tree
  8. [ ] Compare results with browser-tools MCP functionality
  9. [ ] Document findings and next steps if issues persist
- **Test Plan**: 
  1. [ ] Confirm Playwright MCP server shows as ✓ Connected in `claude mcp list`
  2. [ ] Verify mcp__playwright__ functions are available and accessible
  3. [ ] Successfully navigate to test website using Playwright MCP
  4. [ ] Take screenshot and verify file is saved to expected location
  5. [ ] Capture page snapshot and verify detailed accessibility tree output
  6. [ ] Test basic interaction capabilities (click, type) if applicable
  7. [ ] Verify no conflicts with browser-tools MCP (both should work simultaneously)
- **Troubleshooting**: If MCP connection fails again:
  1. [x] Check MCP error logs: `find ~/.cache/claude-cli-nodejs -name "*playwright*" -type f`
  2. [x] Read log contents for specific error messages (Found ENOENT error)
  3. [x] Try alternative configurations: removed `-y` flag from npx command
  4. [x] Document error patterns: `-y` flag in npx commands causes Claude MCP parsing issues
  5. [x] Test MCP protocol directly: `npx @playwright/mcp@0.0.32` responds correctly to MCP protocol
  6. [x] Try `--yes` instead of `-y`: `npx --yes @playwright/mcp@0.0.32` configured and ready for restart test
