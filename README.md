# Claude Control

Experiments in keeping Claude Code under control for software projects.

## What it is

Start with `CLAUDE.md` and the files in `.claude/` to manage Claude Code for a software project. Prompt Claude with your requirements and architecture, then ask it to generate and perform tasks.

## Usage

1. Copy to your project:
   - CLAUDE.md
   - .claude/
2. Tell Claude your requirements and architecture
3. Ask Claude to generate tasks
4. Let Claude work through the tasks

Tasks are tracked with numbers for easy reference (`1.3` = task 1, step 3).
